### User Authentication
Users can sign in using Google or email/password authentication, and their fitness data will be stored in Firestore.

After signing in, users fill out a detailed form with personal fitness information (e.g., age, body type, goals), and the app will generate a workout plan using AI.

### Exercise Management
In each workout day, users can:
- **Complete** exercises, which updates the progress.
- **Replace** exercises with AI suggestions.
- **Like** exercises and save them to a "Favorites" list for later access.

### Progress Tracking
Users can track their weekly progress based on completed exercises and navigate through their workout history.

### Favorites
Liked exercises are saved to a collection attached to the user, allowing easy access in the “Favorites” tab.
